## Problem Description

```
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4


Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1


Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1


 Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-104 <= target <= 104
```
## Key Points

- iterate on the array elements to find first that breaks the ascending sort that makes we have two subarray.
- we will applay the binary serach for the two subarray to find the target.

## Code

- Available Languages: C++.

C++ Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
   int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
      int sz = nums.size();
      int i = 0;
      for (; i < sz-1; i++)
      {
         if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1])
            break;
      }
      int low = 0, high = i, mid = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++)
      {
         while (low <= high)
         {
            mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target)
               return mid;
            else if (nums[mid] > target)
               high = mid - 1;
            else
               low = mid + 1;
         }
         low = i + 1, high = sz - 1;
      }
      return -1;
   }
};
```
