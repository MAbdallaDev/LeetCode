## Problem Description


```

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1


Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-104 <= target <= 104is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

```
## Key Points

- here we just implement the binary serach algorithm.

## Code

- Available Languages: C++.

C++ Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
   int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
      if(target < nums[0]) return 0;
      if(target>nums.back()) return nums.size();
      int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
      while (low<=high)
      {
         mid = (low + high) / 2;
         if (nums[mid] == target)
            return mid;
         else if (nums[mid] > target)
            high = mid - 1;
         else
            low = mid + 1;
      }
      return low;
   }
};
```
