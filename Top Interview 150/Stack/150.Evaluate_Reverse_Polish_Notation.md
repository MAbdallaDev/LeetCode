## Problem Description

```
You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
There will not be any division by zero.
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.
 

Example 1:

Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9


Example 2:

Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6


Example 3:

Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
 

Constraints:

1 <= tokens.length <= 104
tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].

```

## Key Points

- Iterate on the tokens and if the current token is operand push it on stack.
- it it operator we pop the top two values in the stack which indicates the two operands of arithmetic expression and and identify which operator is 
- finally push the result of expression in the stack and repeat these steps untill the last token in the array 

## Code

- Available Languages: C++.

C++ Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
   int evalRPN(vector<string>& tokens) {
      int op1 = 0, op2 = 0, res = 0;
      stack<int>st;
      for (auto& token : tokens)
      {
         if(token == "+" || token == "-" || token == "*" || token == "/" )
         {
            op2 = st.top();
            st.pop();
            op1 = st.top();
            st.pop();
            if (token == "+")
               res = op1 + op2;

            else if (token == "-")
               res = op1 - op2;
            
            else if (token == "*")
               res = op1 * op2;
            
            else res = op1 / op2;
            
            st.push(res);
         }

         else st.push(stoi(token));
      }
      return st.top();
   }
};
