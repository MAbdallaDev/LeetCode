## Problem Description

```
Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:

The path starts with a single slash '/'.
Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')
Return the simplified canonical path.

Example 1:

Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

-----------
Example 2:

Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

-----------
Example 3:

Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

```

## Key Points

- Use istringstream we can read the path without '/' and push it into array .
- iterate on this array and check if the current token if is a real directory name if true push it into stack or if not and the current is '..' pop the top of the stack
- finally rearange the tokens in the stack and push it into final path.

## Code

- Available Languages: C++.

C++ Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        int len = path.length();
        if (len == 1) return "/";
        istringstream iss(path);
        string temp = "";
        vector <string>tokens;
        stack<string> st;
        while (getline(iss,temp,'/'))
        {
            if (temp != "")
               tokens.push_back(temp);
        }
        for (string &token : tokens)
        {
            if (token == ".." && !st.empty())
               st.pop();
            else if (token != ".." && token != ".")
               st.push(token);
        }
        path = "";
        while (!st.empty())
        {
            path = '/' + st.top() + path;
            st.pop();
        }
        return (path == "") ? "/" : path;
    }
};
```

Another Solution Same logic But Without istringstream and Better In Memory Usage

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        int len = path.length();
         if (len == 1) return "/";
         string temp = "";
         stack<string> st;
         for (int i = 1; i < len; i++)
         {
            while (i<len && path[i] != '/')
            {
               temp += path[i];
               i++;
            }
            if (temp == ".." && !st.empty())
               st.pop();
            else if (temp != "." && temp != ".." && temp != "")
               st.push(temp);
            temp = "";
         }
         path = "";
         while (!st.empty())
         {
            path = '/' + st.top() + path;
            st.pop();
         }
         return (path == "") ? "/" : path;
    }
};
```
