## Problem Description


```
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

```
Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.


Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105

```
## Key Points

- we basically find the left max and right max and based on that we start our movement in two pointer.
- Now if the new left height is greater than max left height then we update the lmax height and similarly for the right side.
- when the left most point become less than right most point and higher than the current left we add the differnce (water += lmax - height[left++] )
- to the trapped water counter and the same to right side if is less then the left most point and the current right.
## Code

- Available Languages: C++.


C++ Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
   int trap(vector<int>& height) {
      int n = (int)height.size() ;
      int left = 1, right = n-2  ;
      int lmax = height[0] , rmax = height[n-1] , water = 0;
      while (left <= right)
      {
         if (lmax <= height[left])
            lmax = height[left++];
         
         else if (rmax <= height[right])
            rmax = height[right--];
         
         else if (lmax <= rmax && lmax > height[left])
            water += lmax - height[left++];

         else 
            water += rmax - height[right--];
      }
      return water;
   }
};
```
